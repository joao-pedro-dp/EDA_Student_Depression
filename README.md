# EDA_Student_Depression

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on identifying patterns in student depression, segmented by gender. It was created to improve my skills in data analysis, visualization, and insight generation.
The dataset used in this project is **DF student-depression**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset), originally published by **Adil Shamim**.
